### Retrieve information for each rover
This project is a part of the Udacity JavaScript Nano Degree program. The application fetches information and three pictures for each of the three Mars rovers. You can select any of the three rovers to view their respective data, which includes the rover's name, landing date, status, and three pictures taken by the rover.
